We got the total squad points working in leaderboard model, the only thing missing is that it needs the data to be pushed up to the squadpoints row in the children's table.
Graig also mentioned to clean up the tables:Team, Squad, Points
they have MemberID, teamid and squadID that all means the samething, just has different names. Double check with graig on what he wants them to be called
